# JIRA

JIRA is a software testing tool developed by the Australian Company Atlassian. It is a bug tracking tool that 

reports all the issues related to your software or mobile apps. The word JIRA comes from the Japanese word, 

i.e., "Gojira" which means Godzilla.

JIRA is one of the most widely used open source testing tool used in manual testing.


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  What is JIRA?

JIRA is a project management tool used for issues and bugs tracking system. It is widely used as an 

issue-tracking tool for all types of testing. This tutorial introduces the readers to the fundamental 

features, usage, and advantages of JIRA. This tutorial will guide the users on how to utilize this tool to 

track and report bugs in different applications.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
* The following are the useful aspects provided by the Jira:

![image](image/jira-introduction.png)

1. Projects: It is used to manage the defects very effectively.

2. Issue: It is used to track and manage the defects/issues.

3. Workflow: Processes the Issue/Defect life cycle. Suppose we have a business requirement, we create the  

   technical design and from the technical design, we create the test cases. After creating the test cases, 

   coding is done, and then testing is performed on the project. This design workflow is possible by using 
   
   Jira.

4. Search: Find with ease. Suppose we have done with a project at the beginning of the December and its 

   version is 1.0. Now, we move to version 1.1 and completed at the end of December. What we are doing is that 
   
   we are adding new versions. Through Jira, we can get to know that what happened in the earlier versions, 
   
   how many defects occurred in the earlier projects and the learning we achieve from the earlier projects.

5. Dashboards: Dashboard is a display which you see when you log in to the Jira. You can create multiple 

   dashboards for multiple projects. You can create the personal dashboard and can add the gadgets in a 
   
   dashboard so that you can keep track of the assignments and issues that you are working on.

### Why JIRA?

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*   Plan, Track and Work Faster

JIRA is a bug-tracking tool mainly used to track, organize, and prioritize the bugs, newly added features, 

improvements for certain software releases. Projects are subdivided into issues and issues can be of multiple 

types such as bug, new feature, improvement, and documentation tasks.


When the release date of software comes near, then software developers need to focus on the remaining issues 

which are to be fixed before the specified date. It also becomes difficult for the QA to maintain the status 

of the documentation, i.e., sometimes it becomes hard to keep track of everything.

JIRA is a good choice for handling the above issues. It enables software developers to track issues and 

improvements. It manages the projects as well as maintain the technical documentation.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  The main source of information

JIRA is the primary source of information for the next software release. On JIRA, the whole team of the 

software developers can plan for the new features which are to be added and bugs to be fixed in the next 

release.

It also helps the QA team in writing the technical documentation. Through JIRA, the QA team can check the 

status of each feature that is newly added by the software developers, and according to that, they can plan 

how to document for the new version.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Organize the documentation tasks

JIRA tool is used to organize the documentation tasks. It is useful in grouping the multiple tasks by using 

the component functionality, and even you can create your own documentation. In this way, you can create a 

structured way of documentation.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Track the progress of our documentation

It is a very useful tool in tracking the progress of our documentation. JIRA tool provides a very important 

feature, i.e., pie chart macro. In the pie chart macro, you can view tasks such as Open tasks, Closed tasks, 

Resolved tasks.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Helps to meet the deadlines of a documentation release.

You can define the specific due date or deadline for the release of documentation, and even you can configure 

the JIRA tool with the notifications so that you can finish your documentation in time.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Measures the time spent on documentation

JIRA tool does not have the default functionality for measuring the time spent on documentation. JIRA tool is 

bundled with the Tempo Timesheets, which measures how much time has been spent on the documentation.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Provides feedback faster

JIRA tool provides the Confluence pages where you can connect to the issues in just a few clicks. If something 

needs to be updated, then you can create the issues directly from the Confluence page.

# JIRA-Issue Types

Since JIRA tracks all the tasks, the sub-tasks or even a work as an Issue, there are several types of Issues 

to identify the work and categorize the similar issues.

An Issue is classified as follows −

* Sub-Task − This is the sub-task of an issue. In a logged issue, there can be different tasks to resolve it, 

which are called as sub-tasks.

* Bug − A problem that impairs or prevents the functions of the product.

* Epic − A big user story that needs to be broken down. Created by JIRA Software - do not edit or delete.

* Improvement − An improvement or enhancement to an existing feature or task.

* New Feature − A new feature of the product, which is yet to be developed.

* Story − A user story. Created by JIRA Software - do not edit or delete.

* Task − A task that needs to be done to achieve team’s goal.

<!--style="font-size:20px"-->
Step to see the Issue Types-:

If a user logs in as Admin and navigate to Settings → JIRA Administrator → Issues, all the listed issue types 

will display. The following screenshot shows all the available issue types in JIRA.

![image](image/issuetype1.png)


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
Issue Type Schemes

An issue type scheme determines which issue types will be available to a project or set of projects. It also 

manages specifying the order in which the issue types will present in the user interface of JIRA, while 

creating an Issue. An issue type scheme generates as soon as the project is added in the JIRA.

Here, one scheme is by default named as the Default Issue Type Scheme and others are project schemes. The 

default issue type scheme is the list of global issue types. All newly created issue types will automatically 

be added to this scheme. The following screenshot shows Issue type schemes of different projects.

![image](image/issuetype2.png)


By clicking on the Add Issue Type Scheme button at the top right hand corner, the user can add a user defined 

scheme.

Enter the Name, Description and Select the Issue Type for the Current scheme from the Available issue type 

list. The following screenshot shows how to add a new type schema by providing the required and optional 

fields.

![image](image/issuetype3.png)

Click on Save. The new schema will appear in the list. The Following screenshot shows how the page display 

after adding a new Issue Type schema −

![image](image/issuetype4.png)

By clicking on Edit, the user can edit the details. By clicking on Associate, the user can associate this 

scheme to a project. Copy and Delete is used for copying and deletion of the same scheme.


# JIRA-Issue Creation

To create an issue in JIRA, the user should have Create Issue permission in the project. Admin can add/remove 

the permission.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
Steps to Follow

Click on the Create button in the navigation bar to open the create issue dialogue box.

![image](image/issue_creation1.jpg)


To complete the process of creating an issue, we should follow the pointers given below.

* Select the Project where the issue is.

* Select the type of issue, whether it is a bug/new feature/story, etc.

* Write a one-line summary to provide the overall idea about the issue.

* Write the details of the issue in the Description field. Explain the issue, so that stockholders can 

understand every detail of the issue.

* To create a similar type of issue in the same project and issue type, check the checkbox of “Create another” 

otherwise keep it as unchecked.

* After entering all the details, click on the Create button.

The following screenshot shows how to create an issue by providing the required and optional details.

![image](image/issuecreation2.png)

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
The fields in the Create Issue form are explained below.

* Priority − Issue creator can set the priority to resolve the issue as High, Medium, Low, and Lowest.

* Labels − It is similar to Tag; it helps in filtering out specific types of issues.

* Linked Issue − It links other issues that are either dependent on this issue or this issue is dependent on 

them. Options in dropdowns are – block, is blocked by, duplicate, clone, etc.

* Issue − User can link the issue by the Typing ID or summary of those that are related to the linked issue 

field.

* Assignee − The person who is responsible to fix this issue. Assignee name can be entered by the issue 

creator.

* Epic Link − An Issue creator can provide an epic link, if the issue belongs to any of those.

* Sprint − The user can define in which sprint, this issue belongs to, when this issue should be addressed.

# JIRA-Create a Subtask

An issue can be completed by performing many tasks with different persons like Dev, QA, UAT, Business, 

Support, etc. To track the progress in each department, sub-tasks are created in an issue and assigned to the 

concern person. Once all the sub-tasks are resolved, the issue can be marked as completed.


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
Points to Note for Creating a Subtask

The following points are to be considered when creating a subtask.

* All subtasks are an essential part of their parent issue.

* All subtasks are visible on the main screen of the parent issue.

* Subtasks always belong to the same project as their parent issue.

* Subtask has all fields that are present in the standard issue.

* Subtasks cannot have a subtask of their own.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
Steps to Follow for Creating a Subtask

We should consider the following steps when creating a subtask.

* step 1: GO to Side pain there Backlog Option will come click on that list of all backlog will display.

* step 2: click on the link then pop-up window will come.

* step 3: Window click on '...' then list of option will come in that click on create a subtask.

# JIRA-Create Issue Using CSV

A User can create multiple issues at a time using Comma separated file known as CSV. The CSV files are text 

files those represent tabulated data and separate different sections by commas.

They have two-step process that requires importing the data from a CSV, while a third optional step is also 

present, which are listed below.

1. Prepare a CSV file.
2. Import the CSV file into the system.
3. Save the configuration for future use.


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
1. Prepare the CSV File

While creating a CSV file the following points must be considered.

Each CSV file should have a heading row with a summary column. The first row is the heading row and represents 

the fields of the create issue page. Example − Summary, Assignee, Reporter, Priority, Description, sprint, 

“Test Suite”, Ashish, Ashish, 1, etc.

* Use double quote marks (“) in the CSV file to capture data that appears in multip.le lines. For Example − 

upon import, JIRA will treat the following CSV as a single record: Summary, Description, Status, "Login 

issue", "This is on a new line", Open

* While importing issues from a CSV file, the Project Name and Project Key are important columns in CSV. In 

addition, the name of these fields should match exactly as they are present in JIRA.


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
2. Import the CSV File

To import the CSV file, we should follow the steps given below.

Step 1 − Select Issues → Import Issues from CSV to open the Bulk Create Setup page.

The following screenshot shows how to access the Import issues from the CSV functionality.

![image](image/csv1.jpg)

Step 2 − On the Setup page, select CSV Source File. Do not check the “Use an existing configuration file” 

check box, if you do not have a configuration file or if you want to create a new configuration file.

Configuration files specify a mapping between column names in the CSV file's header row and fields in the JIRA 

application.

The following screenshot shows the Bulk create setup page, where the user browses and uploads the CSV file.

![image](image/csv2.jpg)

Step 3 − If the user checks the checkbox of “Use an existing configuration file”, JIRA will ask to specify an 

Existing Configuration File.

The following screenshot shows how to use an existing configuration file.

Step 4 − If the user does not select this option, then at the end of the CSV file import wizard, JIRA will ask 

to create a configuration file, which can be used for subsequent CSV imports.

Click on the Next button → the Settings step of the CSV file import wizard will display. Complete the required 

fields. If the CSV file uses a different separator character other than a comma, specify that character in the 

CSV Delimiter field. If the separator is a 'Tab', this can be entered using the format '/t'.

The following screenshot shows how to provide settings of csv file −

Step 5 − Click on the Next button to proceed to the Map field’s step of the CSV file import wizard. Here, the 

user has to map the column headers of the CSV file to the fields in the selected JIRA project. After 

selection, tick the check box for Map field value.

A CSV field should map to the JIRA summary field. This ensures the issues created have a summary.

The following screenshot shows how to map CSV fields with JIRA fields −

Step 6 − Click on the Next button, the Map values step of the CSV file import wizard will display. On this 

step of the import wizard, the user can select which specific CSV field values to map to which specific JIRA 

field value.

* Fields whose Map Field Value check boxes were selected in the previous step will be presented on this page.

* If the CSV field has a username (e.g. Reporter or Assignee) and does not select the Map Field Value check 

box for this field in the previous step of the CSV file import wizard, then the importer will map imported 

usernames from the CSV file to (lowercase) JIRA usernames.

The following screenshot shows how to map values.

# JIRA-Search

JIRA has powerful and very efficient search functionalities. A user can search issues across Projects, 

Versions and Components using various search types. JIRA allows saving the search criteria to utilize next 

time as filters; even these filters can be shared by others as well.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
Types of Searching Options

JIRA has a couple of fundamental ways to search issues. The most important ones are as follows.

* Basic Search

* Quick Search


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
1.  Basic Search

Basic Search in JIRA is a user-friendly interface that can be used easily to find out the issues. It uses the 

JQL queries in the backend. To do a basic search in JIRA, the user has to follow the steps given below.

Step 1 − Navigate to issues → Search Issues. The following screenshot shows how to access the Search for 

Issues feature −

If we click on'...' then all the option will come you can work on your requirement.


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
2.  Quick Search

The quick search is the fastest way to define search criteria. It is a text box where the user enters the 

key, text or anything and it starts searching for the exact matches in the current project and provides the 

result.

The Quick Search box is available on the top right hand corner of the navigator. The following screenshot 

shows how to access the Quick Search feature.

![image](image/search5.png)


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
Smart Querying

The quick search option performs smart searches with minimal typing. It recognizes the following word and 

gives out several options to the user to choose.

* my − This word searches issues assigned to the logged-in user.

The following screenshot shows different smart querying in a quick search.

![image](image/search6.jpg)

Some of the most commonly used smart querying options are as follows −

* r:me − Finds issues reported by the logged-in user.

* r:abc − Finds issues reported by user – abc.

* r:none − Finds issues with no reporter.

* <project name> or <project key> − Finds issues within the given project name or finds issues having the 

same project key.

* Overdue − Finds issues those are overdue before today.

* Created:, updated:, due: − These smart searches finds issues with Created, Updated, or Due Date using the 

prefixes created:, updated:, or due:, respectively. For the date range, use today, tomorrow, yesterday, a 

single date range (e.g. '-1w'), or two date ranges (e.g. '-1w,1w'). Date ranges cannot have spaces between 

them. Valid date/time abbreviations are: 'w' (week), 'd' (day), 'h' (hour), 'm' (minute).

* C: − Finds issues with a particular component.

* V: − Finds issues with a particular version.

* Ff: − Finds issues with a Fixed For version.

* − Wildcard can be utilized with any of the above queries to find issues.
