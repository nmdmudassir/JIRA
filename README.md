# JIRA

JIRA is a software testing tool developed by the Australian Company Atlassian. It is a bug tracking tool that 

reports all the issues related to your software or mobile apps. The word JIRA comes from the Japanese word, 

i.e., "Gojira" which means Godzilla.

JIRA is one of the most widely used open source testing tool used in manual testing.


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  What is JIRA?

JIRA is a project management tool used for issues and bugs tracking system. It is widely used as an 

issue-tracking tool for all types of testing. This tutorial introduces the readers to the fundamental 

features, usage, and advantages of JIRA. This tutorial will guide the users on how to utilize this tool to 

track and report bugs in different applications.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
* The following are the useful aspects provided by the Jira:

![image](image/jira-introduction.png)

1. Projects: It is used to manage the defects very effectively.

2. Issue: It is used to track and manage the defects/issues.

3. Workflow: Processes the Issue/Defect life cycle. Suppose we have a business requirement, we create the  

   technical design and from the technical design, we create the test cases. After creating the test cases, 

   coding is done, and then testing is performed on the project. This design workflow is possible by using 
   
   Jira.

4. Search: Find with ease. Suppose we have done with a project at the beginning of the December and its 

   version is 1.0. Now, we move to version 1.1 and completed at the end of December. What we are doing is that 
   
   we are adding new versions. Through Jira, we can get to know that what happened in the earlier versions, 
   
   how many defects occurred in the earlier projects and the learning we achieve from the earlier projects.

5. Dashboards: Dashboard is a display which you see when you log in to the Jira. You can create multiple 

   dashboards for multiple projects. You can create the personal dashboard and can add the gadgets in a 
   
   dashboard so that you can keep track of the assignments and issues that you are working on.

### Why JIRA?

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*   Plan, Track and Work Faster

JIRA is a bug-tracking tool mainly used to track, organize, and prioritize the bugs, newly added features, 

improvements for certain software releases. Projects are subdivided into issues and issues can be of multiple 

types such as bug, new feature, improvement, and documentation tasks.


When the release date of software comes near, then software developers need to focus on the remaining issues 

which are to be fixed before the specified date. It also becomes difficult for the QA to maintain the status 

of the documentation, i.e., sometimes it becomes hard to keep track of everything.

JIRA is a good choice for handling the above issues. It enables software developers to track issues and 

improvements. It manages the projects as well as maintain the technical documentation.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  The main source of information

JIRA is the primary source of information for the next software release. On JIRA, the whole team of the 

software developers can plan for the new features which are to be added and bugs to be fixed in the next 

release.

It also helps the QA team in writing the technical documentation. Through JIRA, the QA team can check the 

status of each feature that is newly added by the software developers, and according to that, they can plan 

how to document for the new version.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Organize the documentation tasks

JIRA tool is used to organize the documentation tasks. It is useful in grouping the multiple tasks by using 

the component functionality, and even you can create your own documentation. In this way, you can create a 

structured way of documentation.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Track the progress of our documentation

It is a very useful tool in tracking the progress of our documentation. JIRA tool provides a very important 

feature, i.e., pie chart macro. In the pie chart macro, you can view tasks such as Open tasks, Closed tasks, 

Resolved tasks.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Helps to meet the deadlines of a documentation release.

You can define the specific due date or deadline for the release of documentation, and even you can configure 

the JIRA tool with the notifications so that you can finish your documentation in time.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Measures the time spent on documentation

JIRA tool does not have the default functionality for measuring the time spent on documentation. JIRA tool is 

bundled with the Tempo Timesheets, which measures how much time has been spent on the documentation.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
*  Provides feedback faster

JIRA tool provides the Confluence pages where you can connect to the issues in just a few clicks. If something 

needs to be updated, then you can create the issues directly from the Confluence page.

# JIRA-Issue Types

Since JIRA tracks all the tasks, the sub-tasks or even a work as an Issue, there are several types of Issues 

to identify the work and categorize the similar issues.

An Issue is classified as follows −

* Sub-Task − This is the sub-task of an issue. In a logged issue, there can be different tasks to resolve it, 

which are called as sub-tasks.

* Bug − A problem that impairs or prevents the functions of the product.

* Epic − A big user story that needs to be broken down. Created by JIRA Software - do not edit or delete.

* Improvement − An improvement or enhancement to an existing feature or task.

* New Feature − A new feature of the product, which is yet to be developed.

* Story − A user story. Created by JIRA Software - do not edit or delete.

* Task − A task that needs to be done to achieve team’s goal.

<!--style="font-size:20px"-->
Step to see the Issue Types-:

If a user logs in as Admin and navigate to Settings → JIRA Administrator → Issues, all the listed issue types 

will display. The following screenshot shows all the available issue types in JIRA.

![image](image/issuetype1.png)


<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
Issue Type Schemes

An issue type scheme determines which issue types will be available to a project or set of projects. It also 

manages specifying the order in which the issue types will present in the user interface of JIRA, while 

creating an Issue. An issue type scheme generates as soon as the project is added in the JIRA.

Here, one scheme is by default named as the Default Issue Type Scheme and others are project schemes. The 

default issue type scheme is the list of global issue types. All newly created issue types will automatically 

be added to this scheme. The following screenshot shows Issue type schemes of different projects.

![image](image/issuetype2.png)


By clicking on the Add Issue Type Scheme button at the top right hand corner, the user can add a user defined 

scheme.

Enter the Name, Description and Select the Issue Type for the Current scheme from the Available issue type 

list. The following screenshot shows how to add a new type schema by providing the required and optional 

fields.

![image](image/issuetype3.png)

Click on Save. The new schema will appear in the list. The Following screenshot shows how the page display 

after adding a new Issue Type schema −

By clicking on Edit, the user can edit the details. By clicking on Associate, the user can associate this 

scheme to a project. Copy and Delete is used for copying and deletion of the same scheme.


# JIRA-Issue Creation

To create an issue in JIRA, the user should have Create Issue permission in the project. Admin can add/remove 

the permission.

<!--style="font-size:30px"-->
Steps to Follow

Click on the Create button in the navigation bar to open the create issue dialogue box.

* Write a one-line summary to provide the overall idea about the issue.

* Write the details of the issue in the Description field. Explain the issue, so that stockholders can 

understand every detail of the issue.

* To create a similar type of issue in the same project and issue type, check the checkbox of “Create another” 

otherwise keep it as unchecked.

* After entering all the details, click on the Create button.

The following screenshot shows how to create an issue by providing the required and optional details.
